Retail Data Analysis
Introduction
Welcome to the Retail Data Analysis project! This project aims to provide in-depth insights into retail sales data using SQL queries. The dataset used is a copy of an online retail dataset, which includes information about sales transactions, customers, and products. By analyzing this data, we can uncover valuable insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, product popularity, and geographic trends.

Objectives
1. Sales Performance Analysis
Description:
This objective focuses on evaluating the overall sales performance. We calculate total sales per invoice and assess customer lifetime value to identify high-value customers. We also analyze monthly sales trends to understand how sales fluctuate over time.

Queries:

Total Sales Calculation: Computes the total sales amount for each invoice.
Customer Lifetime Value: Determines the total amount spent by each customer and ranks them by their lifetime value.
Monthly Sales Trends: Analyzes total sales on a monthly basis to identify seasonal patterns.
2. Customer Insights
Description:
This objective aims to gain insights into customer behavior and spending patterns. We identify the top customers based on their total spend and analyze their purchasing patterns to understand which products are frequently bought together.

Queries:

Top Customers: Lists the top 10 customers by total spend.
Customer Purchase Patterns: Examines the frequency of purchases for each customer and product combination.
3. Product Analysis
Description:
This objective focuses on understanding product performance. We identify the best-selling products and analyze stock turnover rates to manage inventory more effectively.

Queries:

Best-Selling Products: Lists products based on the total quantity sold.
Stock Turnover: Calculates the average quantity sold per product to gauge turnover rates.
4. Geographic Analysis
Description:
This objective explores sales performance across different geographic regions. We analyze total sales by country and track regional sales trends over time.

Queries:

Sales by Country: Aggregates sales data by country to understand geographic distribution.
Regional Trends: Examines sales trends on a monthly basis for each country.
5. Invoice Analysis
Description:
This objective involves analyzing the frequency and quality of invoices. We count the number of invoices issued each month and check for any data quality issues in the invoice records.

Queries:

Invoice Frequency: Counts the number of invoices issued each month.
Data Quality Check: Identifies records with missing values in key columns.
6. Customer Segmentation
Description:
This objective aims to segment customers based on their total spend. This segmentation helps in understanding customer distribution and targeting marketing efforts more effectively.

Queries:

Segment by Spend: Groups customers based on their total spend and ranks them.
Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of retail data through various SQL queries. By focusing on sales performance, customer insights, product analysis, geographic trends, invoice analysis, and customer segmentation, we can derive actionable insights that support strategic decision-making in a retail context. The queries included offer a foundation for deeper analysis and can be tailored further based on specific business needs or additional data.

Feel free to explore and modify the SQL queries to fit your requirements. Contributions and suggestions for further analysis are welcome!
